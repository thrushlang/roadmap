# Thrush Programming Language 

## Roadmap > Conventional > Compile Time Code Execution

This article will briefly explain how the Thrush compiler will have the ability to execute dynamic code at compile time, with the addition of type generation from C header types.

------------

- `jit.md` Explains the general integration of a just-in-time compiler into ahead-of-time compilation in Thrush, allowing code execution at compile time.

- `typeres.md` Explains the integration of CBindgen for compile-time type resolution support for the just-in-time compiler built into Thrush.
