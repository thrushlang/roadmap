# Thrush Programming Language 

## Roadmap > Conventional Programming > C Code Execution

This new feature of Thrush is the ability to compile C files directly. It's inspired by the D implementation for C.

### Resolution

To introduce this new feature, we need to know that creating a C frontend from scratch takes time, and Thrush doesn't have that time, so we're going to resort to using certain alternatives.

#### Clang Frontend

The idea is to embed the clang frontend directly into the Thrush compiler, allowing C code to be processed directly in Thrush. This is entirely possible due to the following explanation.

#### Lib Clang

It's a library from the LLVM project that provides a wrapper for the entire Clang frontend, allowing us to process C or C++ files directly.

This would be achieved using the ``clang-sys`` wrapper available in Rust as a crate.

For more information about ``libclang``: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibClang.html

#### Code Generation

Processing C files directly and passing them to Thrush's intermediate code is entirely possible without losing compatibility, since Thrush is internally very similar to C; only the syntax changes overtly. This creates backward compatibility between code generated by the Thrush compiler and code generated by other C compilers.

### Priority

This phase of development of the programming language and compiler is of medium priority, but it is not expected to take place before other, more urgently needed developments.
